<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This FAQ page answers the most common questions about TellMyLocation.com and how it works.</p>

<h2>1. What does TellMyLocation.com do?</h2>
<p>The site shows your real-time location, address, weather, altitude, IP address, and nearby places using trusted APIs. Everything loads instantly and works directly in your browser.</p>

<h2>2. Do you store my location?</h2>
<p>No. Your location is processed locally on your device and never stored, saved, or logged by us.</p>

<h2>3. Why do I need to allow location access?</h2>
<p>Your browser requires permission before sharing your GPS coordinates. Without permission, we cannot show your exact location or nearby places.</p>

<h2>4. What if I deny location access?</h2>
<p>The site will still load, but features like your exact location, address, and nearby places will not work.</p>

<h2>5. How accurate is the location?</h2>
<p>Accuracy depends on your device, browser, and GPS signal. Phones are usually very accurate. Laptops may vary based on Wi-Fi positioning.</p>

<h2>6. What APIs or services do you use?</h2>
<p>We use trusted providers including OpenStreetMap, Nominatim, Open‑Meteo, Open‑Elevation, Overpass API, ipapi.co, and Leaflet.js.</p>

<h2>7. Do you track or sell my data?</h2>
<p>No. We do not track, store, sell, or share any personal information. All data is processed in real time and disappears when you leave the site.</p>

<h2>8. Why do you show my IP address?</h2>
<p>Your IP address helps display your ISP and general network information. It is not stored or linked to any profile.</p>

<h2>9. Why are some nearby places missing?</h2>
<p>Nearby places come from OpenStreetMap. If a location is missing, it may not be listed in their database yet.</p>

<h2>10. Does the site work worldwide?</h2>
<p>Yes. The site works globally as long as your device supports location access and you have an internet connection.</p>

<h2>11. Is TellMyLocation.com free?</h2>
<p>Yes. The site is completely free to use. Optional ads or donations help support the project.</p>
